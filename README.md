###Speech Dewey

This project was developed by Elyse Dawson as a capstone project marking the completion of the front-end portion of Nashville Software School's Full-Time Web Development program.

###What is Speech Dewey?

Speech Dewey is a simple to use flash card app to improve language skills for those who have aphasia or other word finding problems.

After my mother had a stroke, she suffered from aphasia and was given all kinds of different worksheets and exercises to help with her language rehabilitation. She became overwhelmed, plateaued in her recovery and ultimately gave up on studying on her own. There are no easy apps to help patients once they leave hospital care or for low income families who cannot afford speech therapy. Current applications tend to be aimed toward speech therapists which makes them too verbose for a patient to use independently.
